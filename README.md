# Monolayer_phase_prediction
Code for predicting the phase of monolayer (quasi-crystal/hexatic/liquid) based on the particle coordinates only. Data consisted of 800-frame MD trajectories of 10000 particle monolayers of fixed temperatures. Labels have been assigned beforehand by inspecting sixfold bond orientational correlation function.
